  hash map: 
    key (string label) -> value (node object)  pairs of (neighbor, dists)
    hash to another hash map containing neighbors key: neighbor val: dists

    hash to another hash map
 use unordered maps



  use a queue, priority queue for BFS, Dijkstra

  disjointSet for connecting threshold  // implement a helper 
    using a backing array
